Evercore’s&nbsp;Julian Emanuel&nbsp;is expecting a more substantial decline of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/T0H1F0GPFHST" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as much as 15%</a>. And a team at Deutsche Bank led by&nbsp;Parag Thatte&nbsp;notes that a small drawdown in equities is overdue considering they’ve been on a tear for over three months.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>“Over the last couple of weeks, we have noted that investors should expect a modest pullback in the third quarter,” Wilson said in his note to clients.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:image {"id":389,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://auzanhou.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-9.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-389" /></figure> <!-- /wp:image --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>The calls are coming amid mounting concerns about the US economy after data last week showed an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-31/key-us-inflation-gauge-picks-up-as-spending-barely-rises" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uptick in inflation</a>&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/us-adds-73-000-jobs-after-downward-revisions-in-prior-months" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weakening job growth</a>&nbsp;and consumer spending. In addition, stocks are entering what’s usually their weakest time of the year. Over the past three decades, the S&amp;P 500 has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-30/s-p-500-s-banner-rally-faces-off-with-worst-two-months-of-year" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">performed the worst</a>&nbsp;in August and September, losing 0.7% on average in each month, compared with a 1.1% gain on average across other months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>In addition, stocks have gotten expensive. The S&amp;P 500’s 14-day relative strength index&nbsp;topped 76&nbsp;last week — its highest point since July 2024 before US stocks briefly peaked last summer and above the 70 level that market technicians view as a sign of overheating.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>Options trading is also showing the fear of a downturn, as hedging against another rout&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/fear-of-stock-market-dive-creeps-back-as-hedging-costs-climb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">becomes more expensive</a>.

Deutsche’s Thatte points out that historically the S&amp;P 500 experiences small pullbacks of around 3% every one-and-a-half-to-two months on average, and larger ones of 5% or more every three-to-four months.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>“We’re&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-04/morgan-stanley-s-wilson-says-buy-stocks-dip-on-earnings-strength" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">buyers of dips</a>,” Wilson told clients.</p> <!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --> <p>So far, traders are heeding the advice.
